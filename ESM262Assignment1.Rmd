output: html_document
1: graph precipitation and average temp by month with boxplot
2: find wettest and dryest years
3: Add two picture to illustrate when a wet and dry year might look like for the ecosystem of your choice
4: create a new variable that is 1 when its spring, 2 whens its summer, 3 for fall and 4 when it's winter
5: find wettest and dryest seasons
6: graph the relationship between winter precipp and summer temp
7: add soe text to describe the graph and comment on why this might be useful to look at
8: make at least on edit to your file and commit changes
9: make sure your work includes code, headings
10: output your work to a pdf and then to slides

Winter (season 4) is the wettest season, while Summer (season 2) is the driest season

```{r question 7}

winterrain = aggregate(climatetable2$rain, list(season = climatetable2$season==4, year = climatetable2$year), mean)

summertempmin = aggregate(climatetable2$tmin, list(season = climatetable2$season==2, year = climatetable2$year), mean)
summertempmax = aggregate(climatetable2$tmax, list(season = climatetable2$season==2, year = climatetable2$year), mean)
summertemp = (summertempmin + summertempmax) / 2



boxplot(summertemp$x~winterrain$x,
        ylab = "Summer Temperature (C)",
        xlab = "Winter Rain",
        col = "green")

```


The graph above models the effect of summer temperature on the amount of rain during the winter later that year. This graph would be useful to utilize when predicting the effects global warming and other fluctuations in temperature may have on rainfall patterns.
